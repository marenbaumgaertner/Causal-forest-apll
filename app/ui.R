                                            Hence, the RORR presents a flat regression-line. For values larger than -1.5,

                                            where the corresponding observations end up more often in the same leaf (=green points). 
                                            At the y-axis (res_y) the green residuals are centered around zero,
                                            because the outcome model fits well the observations corresonding y-values

                                          for a new observation, causal forests give higher weights
                                          to observations with a similar value for the important variable

                                          with a high value of x are predominantly located on the
                                          right side of the graph (on the side for the treated
